Some comments, links and scripts on bnp-cardif competition

This is a classification problem, with log loss measure

##Â Features

As seen on several blog post, there an huge ratio of missing values (NA).
Lots of dataviz on the scripts sections :

Obviously there are categorical and continous variables.
Some script take a subset of the variable.
One of the explanation could be that feature comes from 3 differents system. It can explain some similarity. Some people have tried to separate the features in 3 parts and predict independantly, but seems not working.


## Main algos

1. ks test approach + ensembling
see 
good perf.

2. Decision tree ensembling script using scikit-learn
 Random Forest + Extra Tree + Gradient Boosting (scikit learn implementation)

this script gives also an imporante figure for this 3 algos.
 
3. Extra tree

 With this 3 approachs + another linear combination , you can get a top 200 submission

## Neural network
There is a Tensorflow starter code, but not very interesting (only one layer).

The best one seems a starter code using Lasagne / Theano.
It demands a lot of tuning.
